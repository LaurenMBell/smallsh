My implementation for Oregon State University's Operating Systems (CS 364) final assignment.

Features:
- Allow for the redirection of standard input and standard output
- Supports both foreground and background processes (controllable by the command line and by receiving signals)
- Supports three built in commands: exit, cd, and status
- Support comments (starting with "#")
